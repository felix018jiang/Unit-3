    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to get an idea about the cost of living in a state is to look at its
            Median Home Price. The median home price is measured by lining up the house sales of that state in numerical
            order, from lowest to highest, and then finding the number that is directly in the middle of that list. It
            splits the distribution neatly into two parts: houses that cost above the median home price of a state, and
            houses that cost less than the median income of a state.</span></p>
